    "# Problem 1\n",
    "For this problem you will be using the Python vehicle simulator in the following Python block. The Federal Test Procedure (city) and (highway) drive cycles are described as the speed (in miles per hour) at each second of the drive cycle. The two drive cycles are provided as citycycle.csv and highwaycycle.csv. You will need to complete this Python program to model the road load power requirements over the course of the cycle and answer the following questions about an average 2018 midsize vehicle weighing 1,474 kg, with a frontal area of 2.08 m2, coefficient of drag CD of 0.27 and tires with a rolling resistance of CRR = 0.0075.  Considering both drive cycles answer the following:\n",
    "**1. What is the peak braking power requirement for this vehicle over the drive cycle? At the peak braking power point, what is the fraction of the total negative inertial power due to the brakes, rolling resistance and aerodynamic drag?**\n",
    "\n",
    "City Cycle  \n",
    "The peak braking power requirement for this vehicle is 25.38 kW. At the peak braking power point, 5.0% is attributed to the rolling power, 2.8% is attributed to the aero power, and 92.2% is attributed to the braking power.  \n",
    "Highway Cycle  \n",
    "The peak braking power requirement for this vehicle is 35.85 kW. At the peak braking power point, 4.8% is attributed to the rolling power, 4.9% is attributed to the aero power, and 90.3% is attributed to the braking power. \n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Over the full drive cycle, what is the total energy required to overcome the road load? What is the fraction of this energy due to inertia, rolling resistance and aerodynamic drag?**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "City Cycle  \n",
    "The total energy required to overcome the road load is 5.35 MJ. Of this energy, 24.3% of it is attributed to rolling energy, 17.9% of it is attributed to aero energy, and 57.8% is attributed to inertial energy.  \n",
    "Highway Cycle  \n",
    "The total energy required to overcome the road load is 13.25 MJ. Of this energy, 27% of it is attributed to rolling energy, 47.1% of it is attributed to aero energy, and 25.9% is attributed to inertial energy. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. What is the amount of energy lost to braking? Does this equal the negative of inertial energy required to move the vehicle? Explain why it does or does not equal the inertial energy.**  \n",
    "The amount of energy lost to braking was 2.36 MJ for the city cycle and 1.46 MJ for the highway cycle. It is not the negative of the inertial energy, which was 3.09 MJ and 3.43 MJ respectively, because the inertial energy is the energy the vehicle has when in motion which is different to energy lost to braking which represents the friction and heat energy created during braking. Furthermore, the vehicle can decelerate through coasting which reduces the energy lost to braking when compared to the inertial energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Mass vs Aerodynamic Reduction Impact on Total Energy](mass_aerodynamic_reduction.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Does a 6% reduction in mass or aerodynamic properties (cd*A) of the vehicle have a greater impact on total energy required to overcome the road load? In the context of the drive cycle explain why the reduction has a greater impact.**  \n",
    "A 6% reduction in mass (1474.0 to 1385.56 kg) yields a greater reduction in total energy than a 6% reduction in the drag coefficient (0.27 to 0.2538). This is because a reduction in the drag coefficient only has an impact on the aerodynamic energy used to move a vehicle while a reduction weight reduces the required rolling and inertial energy used during both the city and highway drive cycles, subsequently yielding a greater reduction and impact on the total energy required to overcome the road load.  \n",

Select a 2022 EV that is on the market and another conventional (or non-plugin hybrid) vehicle in the same vehicle size class (compact, midsize, etc.). Simulate the two vehicles using the simulator for problem 1. Assuming 121.3MJ/gallon of gasoline, compare the weighted EPA fuel economy (55% city + 45% highway) of the two vehicles and the results from the simulations. EVs may be listed in miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (mpgge or mpg-e). Answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. What is the difference in fuel economy between the simulated vehicles and the published EPA numbers? Explain why there is a difference between the results you have from simulation and the published EPA numbers.**  \n",
    "Our electric car had a calculated 136.11 MPG-e compared to its actual EPA estimate of 109 MPG-e. Our internal combustion engine vehicle had a calculated 152.66 MPG versus its EPA estimated 28 MPG. There is a difference between our simulation results and the published EPA numbers because our simulation does not take into account the efficiency of the powertrains. Our EV had a calculated 108.89 MPG-e value, or within 0.1% of its actual EPA estimate, when accounting for an 80% motor efficiency. Similarly, our ICE MPG values were more reasonably similar with a calculated 38 MPG when accounting for the 25% efficiency value of an engine. The remaining difference between our calculated and EPA values can be attributed to how our simulation doesn’t account for other sources of energy loss in ICE vehicles including transmission losses and modeling non-linear relationships between power and fuel efficiency across different gears or with varying engine loads.\n",

    "The city and highway MPG for the EV is similar (109 MPG-e for city driving versus 108 MPG-e for highway driving), while the difference is significantly greater for the conventional vehicle (25 MPG for city driving versus 34 MPG for highway driving). This is because EV’s use brake energy regeneration to recuperate braking losses and regain charge, increasing the miles it can cover and making its efficiency similar to its highway MPG-e estimate. Comparatively, conventional non-hybrid ICE vehicles are not able to turn the lost braking energy back into gasoline and subsequently perform worse during the city cycle. This is in addition to the lack of instant maximum torque and the using lower gears to balance efficiency and initial acceleration from a stop, resulting in a larger disparity between its city and highway cycle EPA estimates."

    "# Problem 3\n",
    "For this problem you will be using the simulator code below that utilizes the code from problem 1. The goal of this problem is to develop a driver (a controller) to drive the vehicle. Unlike the simulation in problem 1 the speed is not input to the vehicle model, but only a power output. The driver will be initialized with the control frequency (assume at least 10Hz), the 0 – 60 mph time, the maximum power output, and percent of max power needed to cruise at 60 mph. The 0 – 60 mph time and the maximum power are values that a driver could be provided before driving the vehicle. Additionally, driving the vehicle, the driver could determine how much accelerator pedal is needed to maintain 60 mph. For each time step of the simulation the driver will need to:\n",
    "1. Calculate the vehicle power given current vehicle speed, target vehicle speed, and a five seconds of time step look ahead.\n",
    "1. The driver must maintain &#177;1 mph of the target speed. (Deviating from the &#177;1 mph invalidates EPA fuel economy tests.)\n",
    "1. The driver must not request more power than the max power provided at initialization.\n",
    "The driver must function on both driving cycles and for vehicles with different parameters. An output CSV file is generated showing the target, min, max, and actual vehicle speed for the drive cycle. This could be helpful if trying to visualize the behavior of the driver. The teams will be compared to one another, with a goal of providing a driver with the best combined fuel economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Helpful Hints:\n",
    "1. The lookahead values could be useful but are not necessary to create an accurate driver.\n",
    "1. Some form a feed forward control may be helpful when trying to develop the driver.\n",
    "1.\tThe power required can be thought of a scaling of the max power. Below shows the breakdown, remember that the percent to hold at 60mph is the aero and rolling at 60mph. The other potion is the required power to increase the mass of the vehicle to 60mph in the 0-60 time.\n",
    "1.\tOnce you have some idea of scaling, you will have a feed forward ballpark amount. You can use the feed forward plus some amount of feedback to calculate the required values. One of the easiest ways is to use PID. There are a lot of ways to calculate the error, but one way is to look at the target speed and the current speed. Another could delay a cycle by looking at the previous target speed and the current speed (how well did you do at meeting the desired target).\n",
    "1.\tTips on tuning PID: It is best to just start with proportional. Integral will help remove steady state error. One gotcha with integral is that the integrated error could potentially spool up (consider situation where desired position is slightly passed some hard limit, so actually where want to be, but error keeps integrating). The spooling up of integral is probably not a huge issue due to the nature of the system. Only add in derivative if you need better response, you may be able to get good results with PI alone.\n",
