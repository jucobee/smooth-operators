    "# Problem 1\n",
    "For this problem you will be using the Python vehicle simulator in the following Python block. The Federal Test Procedure (city) and (highway) drive cycles are described as the speed (in miles per hour) at each second of the drive cycle. The two drive cycles are provided as citycycle.csv and highwaycycle.csv. You will need to complete this Python program to model the road load power requirements over the course of the cycle and answer the following questions about an average 2018 midsize vehicle weighing 1,474 kg, with a frontal area of 2.08 m2, coefficient of drag CD of 0.27 and tires with a rolling resistance of CRR = 0.0075.  Considering both drive cycles answer the following:\n",
    "1. What is the peak braking power requirement for this vehicle over the drive cycle? At the peak braking power point, what is the fraction of the total negative inertial power due to the brakes, rolling resistance and aerodynamic drag?  \n",
    "**YOUR_ANSWER HERE**\n",
    "1. Over the full drive cycle, what is the total energy required to overcome the road load? What is the fraction of this energy due to inertia, rolling resistance and aerodynamic drag?  \n",
    "**YOUR_ANSWER HERE**\n",
    "1. What is the amount of energy lost to braking? Does this equal the negative of inertial energy required to move the vehicle? Explain why it does or does not equal the inertial energy.  \n",
    "**YOUR_ANSWER HERE**\n",
    "1. Does a 6% reduction in mass or aerodynamic properties (cd*A) of the vehicle have a greater impact on total energy required to overcome the road load? In the context of the drive cycle explain why the reduction has a greater impact.  \n",

Select a 2022 EV that is on the market and another conventional (or non-plugin hybrid) vehicle in the same vehicle size class (compact, midsize, etc.). Simulate the two vehicles using the simulator for problem 1. Assuming 121.3MJ/gallon of gasoline, compare the weighted EPA fuel economy (55% city + 45% highway) of the two vehicles and the results from the simulations. EVs may be listed in miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (mpgge or mpg-e). Answer the following questions:\n",

    "# Problem 3\n",
    "For this problem you will be using the simulator code below that utilizes the code from problem 1. The goal of this problem is to develop a driver (a controller) to drive the vehicle. Unlike the simulation in problem 1 the speed is not input to the vehicle model, but only a power output. The driver will be initialized with the control frequency (assume at least 10Hz), the 0 – 60 mph time, the maximum power output, and percent of max power needed to cruise at 60 mph. The 0 – 60 mph time and the maximum power are values that a driver could be provided before driving the vehicle. Additionally, driving the vehicle, the driver could determine how much accelerator pedal is needed to maintain 60 mph. For each time step of the simulation the driver will need to:\n",
    "1. Calculate the vehicle power given current vehicle speed, target vehicle speed, and a five seconds of time step look ahead.\n",
    "1. The driver must maintain &#177;1 mph of the target speed. (Deviating from the &#177;1 mph invalidates EPA fuel economy tests.)\n",
    "1. The driver must not request more power than the max power provided at initialization.\n",
    "The driver must function on both driving cycles and for vehicles with different parameters. An output CSV file is generated showing the target, min, max, and actual vehicle speed for the drive cycle. This could be helpful if trying to visualize the behavior of the driver. The teams will be compared to one another, with a goal of providing a driver with the best combined fuel economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Helpful Hints:\n",
    "1. The lookahead values could be useful but are not necessary to create an accurate driver.\n",
    "1. Some form a feed forward control may be helpful when trying to develop the driver.\n",
    "1.\tThe power required can be thought of a scaling of the max power. Below shows the breakdown, remember that the percent to hold at 60mph is the aero and rolling at 60mph. The other potion is the required power to increase the mass of the vehicle to 60mph in the 0-60 time.\n",
    "1.\tOnce you have some idea of scaling, you will have a feed forward ballpark amount. You can use the feed forward plus some amount of feedback to calculate the required values. One of the easiest ways is to use PID. There are a lot of ways to calculate the error, but one way is to look at the target speed and the current speed. Another could delay a cycle by looking at the previous target speed and the current speed (how well did you do at meeting the desired target).\n",
    "1.\tTips on tuning PID: It is best to just start with proportional. Integral will help remove steady state error. One gotcha with integral is that the integrated error could potentially spool up (consider situation where desired position is slightly passed some hard limit, so actually where want to be, but error keeps integrating). The spooling up of integral is probably not a huge issue due to the nature of the system. Only add in derivative if you need better response, you may be able to get good results with PI alone.\n",
